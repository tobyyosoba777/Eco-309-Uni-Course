                Price discrimination is a pricing strategy used by businesses to 
                charge different prices for the same product or service based 
                on various customer attributes or market conditions. The goal 
                of price discrimination is to maximize revenue by capturing the 
                highest possible price each customer segment is willing to pay.

                There are three main types of price discrimination: <br>

                First-degree price discrimination (Perfect Price Discrimination): 
                In this scenario, the seller charges each customer the maximum price 
                they are willing to pay for the product or service. This means that 
                the seller knows the exact willingness to pay of each individual 
                customer and tailors the price accordingly. First-degree price 
                discrimination is rare in practice because it requires a deep
                 understanding of each customer's preferences and their maximum 
                 willingness to pay. <br><br>

                Second-degree price discrimination: Here, the seller charges 
                different prices based on the quantity or volume of goods or services 
                purchased. This often takes the form of quantity discounts or bulk 
                pricing. For example, when you buy in larger quantities, you get a 
                lower price per unit. <br><br>

                Third-degree price discrimination: This is the most common 
                form of price discrimination and involves charging different 
                prices to different customer segments based on their 
                characteristics, such as age, location, income level, 
                or buying habits. Businesses often use demographic or 
                market data to identify different customer segments and 
                adjust their prices accordingly. For instance, students 
                may get discounted prices for certain products or services, 
                or airline companies may offer lower fares to senior citizens.
